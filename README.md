## 📖 Project Overview

The **PyCore Laboratory** is a centralized repository dedicated to mastering algorithmic challenges and software design patterns using Python. Developed as a foundational technical asset within the **Codiom** initiative, this project serves as a structured environment for testing complex logic and high-performance scripts.

As a Software Engineering student at Istanbul Aydın University, I utilize this repository to bridge the gap between theoretical computer science and practical, clean-code implementations—ensuring that every solution is optimized for both readability and execution speed.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🧩 Algorithmic Deep Dive:** Implementations of classic and advanced algorithms (Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking).
* **🛠️ Data Structure Lab:** Built-from-scratch examples of Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, and Hash Maps.
* **🔍 PEP 8 Compliance:** All solutions are architected following the official Python style guide for maximum maintainability.
* **📈 Complexity Analysis:** Every major problem includes a technical breakdown of its Big O time and space complexity.
* **🤖 AI-Ready Logic:** Foundational scripts designed to support future integration with Machine Learning and Data Science workflows.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Category | Technology | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Language**| **Python 3.9+** | Core development and algorithmic logic. |
| **Mathematics** | **NumPy / Math** | Vectorized operations and complex arithmetic. |
| **Data Engine** | **Pandas** | High-level data manipulation and analysis examples. |
| **Build Tools** | **Pip / Venv** | Managing project-specific dependencies and environments. |
| **Version Control** | **Git / GitHub** | Management of source code and architectural revisions. |

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The repository follows a **Modular Problem-Solving Architecture**, where solutions are categorized by their computational domain rather than just difficulty.



### Mathematical Validation
Model performance and algorithmic efficiency are calculated using standard benchmarks:

* **Big O Notation ($O$):** Ensuring solutions scale linearly or logarithmically wherever possible.
  $$T(n) = O(f(n))$$
* **Resource Optimization:** Careful management of Python’s memory overhead through efficient use of generators and list comprehensions.
